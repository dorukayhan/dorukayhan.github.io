        <p>Hi. I'm Doruk Ayhan (pronounced /'doruk aj'han/). Thanks for checking in!</p>
        <p>Between 2019 and 2023 I went to <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">a top-tier institution of higher education</a> to <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE">learn how to force electricity to do math</a>, and now that I learned it I make it my whole personality. I quite enjoy tinkering with things with no regard for whether they're meant for tinkering and making little doodads out of code whenever I think of some annoyance that ad hoc code could solve, and when I'm not doing those or working I quite enjoy playing stupid live-service grindfest games.</p>
