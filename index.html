		<h1 class="centered">Hello there!</h1>
		<p>I'm dorukayhan, and I code for fun. I used to show up quite frequently on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, but my interest faded away - still, you can check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/6304349/dorukayhan">what I did there</a>.</p>
		
		<p>After visiting a few pages on this site of mine, you might notice that there's very little CSS. That's because I like minimalistic designs and I want my website to reflect that - a neat-looking thing with no distracting props.</p>
		
		<p>.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, so since I have no idea about what else I can write on my homepage and I don't feel like coming up with one (yet), here's a sitemap:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="index.html"><strong>Homepage</strong></a></li>
			<li><a href="blank.html">A blank page for testing and stuff</a></li>
			<li><a href="se-access-tokens.html">Stack Exchange API access token generator</a></li>
			<li>There are more things on the way</li>
			<!--<li><a href="miners-haven/droppers.html">List of Miner's Haven droppers and metrics about their effectiveness</a> (see also <a href="http://minershaven.wikia.com">minershaven.wikia.com</a>)</li>-->
